 Hi, I'm Polina. Here are some things I have made/am making.

 - [PickMyRide](https://github.com/lauraeci/PickMyRide), a Rails app with an Ember.js front end that uses an AHP model to rate cars via the Edmunds vehicle API. This app was started at a PayNearMe hack night in South Bay.
 - [WeAreTechWomen](http://www.wearetechwomen.com/), a community editable site written in Rails for women interested in getting involved and connecting with other women in technology. This app was started at a LadyHacks event in Philadelphia.
 - [TaskCubed](https://github.com/psoshnin/sifteocubes), a game turned 3D task management system in C++ using the Sifteo Cubes gaming platform.
